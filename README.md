**nullsh** is a minimalist Linux shell built around the philosophy of intentionality and silence. It reduces cognitive load, enhances focus, and provides a secure, ephemeral workspace.

---

## âœ¨ Philosophy

`nullsh` interprets "null" as a purposeful design choice:

- **Silence by Default:** Successful commands execute quietly
- **The Void as Feature:** Ephemeral sessions and minimal interface
- **Intentionality:** Every action is a conscious choice
